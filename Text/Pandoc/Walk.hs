Functions for manipulating 'Pandoc' documents or extracting
information from them by walking the 'Pandoc' structure (or
intermediate structures like '[Block]' or '[Inline]'.
These are faster (by a factor of four or five) than the generic
functions defined in @Text.Pandoc.Generic@.

Here's a simple example, defining a function that replaces all the level 3+
headers in a document with regular paragraphs in ALL CAPS:

> import Text.Pandoc.Definition
> import Text.Pandoc.Walk
> import Data.Char (toUpper)
>
> modHeader :: Block -> Block
> modHeader (Header n _ xs) | n >= 3 = Para $ walk allCaps xs
> modHeader x = x
>
> allCaps :: Inline -> Inline
> allCaps (Str xs) = Str $ map toUpper xs
> allCaps x = x
>
> changeHeaders :: Pandoc -> Pandoc
> changeHeaders = walk modHeader

'query' can be used, for example, to compile a list of URLs
linked to in a document:

> extractURL :: Inline -> [String]
> extractURL (Link _ _ (u,_)) = [u]
> extractURL (Image _ _ (u,_)) = [u]
> extractURL _ = []
>
> extractURLs :: Pandoc -> [String]
> extractURLs = query extractURL
